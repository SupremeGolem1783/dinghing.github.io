### Beginner to learn machine learning like me
Books and courses are frustrating. I have read a lot of ariticals and recipes, but never get to see how they all fit together
So, I write a machine learning on a little project to help me to understand.
All the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/dinghing/MachineLearn)

It is done by the below steps
  * Loading the dataset.
  * Summarizing the dataset.
  * Visualizing the dataset.
  * Evaluating some algorithms.
  * Making some predictions.
